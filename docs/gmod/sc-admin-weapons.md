# SC Admin Weapons

> *Just Another Admin Weapons*

I know there are tons of admin guns in the Garry's Mod Workshop. But I couldn't find any add-on that fit my desire, so I decided to make my own version of the admin gun.

## Weapon List
Currently, this add-on provides two weapons. Every weapon shares the same mechanism unless specified.

* Admin Pistol
* Admin Pistol (Clean): Same with 'Admin Pistol, but does not create 'bullet hole'.

### Admin Pistol
Based on the HL2 Pistol with different weapon models for distinguishing purposes.

## Fire Modes
These weapons will fire bullets without consuming any ammunition, regardless of fire mode.

### Primary Fire
This is simple. Primary fire will fire powerful bullets very fast and very hard.  
Press LMB and see heavy containers or heavy cars fly away!

### Secondary Fire
Secondary fire mode has four fire modes. You can change fire mode by pressing the R(Reload) button.

#### Explosion Mode
This will create explosions where your weapon aims.  
Be aware that these explosions can kill you (and your friends)!

#### Airboat Gun Mode
Sometimes, explosions are not enough. In that case, you can fire an Airboat Gun.  
It is highly effective to combine helicopters!

#### Combine Ball Mode
Tired of charging AR2 Alt Fire to shoot combine balls? This fire mode will cover you.  
With this, you can fire a very fast combine ball without any limitation.

#### Armed Grenade Mode
Do you love spamming grenades? This will do the job for you much faster!  
Motivated by [this video](http://youtu.be/LJDTgsXsP0k).

#### (WIP) RPG Rocket Mode
Sometimes, you want to spam RPG rockets. Now you can!  
Note that the speed of the rocket is slower than Combine Ball!

## Known Issue
* None

## FAQ

### This gun looks weird!
This add-on uses a dedicated weapon model. I know the model this add-on uses is not that fancy. Sorry!

> *Random Stuff I've Made*

SC Tools is a collection of random stuff that improves QoL.

For safety reasons, almost everything in SC Tools must be enabled and configured by SuperAdmin first. After that, features that aren't dangerous will be available to every player.

Here are some examples of improvements that SC Tools provides.

* Disconnect players when the map ends
* Enable GodMode for mission-critical NPCs
* Increase crouch speed or ladder speed when pressing ++shift++
* Increase sound speed when game speed changes
* Remove collisions for small objects or players
* Remove small props that are messily scattered
* Remove the red overlay when the player dies
* Show HUD hint

!!! tip "Use the 'x86-64' beta branch!"

    I strongly advise you to switch to the 'x86-64' beta branch of Garry's Mod. It provides a x64 binary that can use more than 4GB of RAM and more useful features.  
    Most features that SC Tools provides will work on the main branch, but some features won't work because they use methods that are not in the main branch.

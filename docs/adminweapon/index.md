> *Just Another Admin Weapons*

I know there are tons of admin guns in the Garry's Mod Workshop. But I couldn't find any add-ons that fit my desire, so I decided to make my own version of the admin gun.

## Weapon List

Every weapon shares the same mechanism unless specified.

* Admin MP5SD  
  Classname: `scaw_mp5sd`
* Admin MP5SD (Clean): Same with 'Admin MP5SD', but does not create a 'bullet hole'.  
  Classname: `scaw_mp5sd_clean`
* Admin Pistol  
  Classname: `scaw_pistol`
* Admin Pistol (Clean): Same with 'Admin Pistol', but does not create a 'bullet hole'.  
  Classname: `scaw_pistol_clean`

### Admin MP5SD

MP5SD with an underbarrel grenade launcher. The grenade launcher is not used yet.

### Admin Pistol

HL2 Pistol, but with a different texture for distinguishing purposes.

## Fire Modes

These weapons will fire bullets without consuming any ammunition, regardless of fire mode.

But you may have to have at least 1 Pistol ammo to fire these weapons.

### Primary Fire

This is simple. Primary fire will fire powerful bullets very fast and very hard.  
Press LMB and see heavy containers or heavy cars fly away!

### Secondary Fire

Secondary fire mode has four fire modes. You can change fire mode by pressing the R(Reload) button.

#### Explosion Mode

This will create explosions where your weapon aims.  
Be aware that these explosions can kill you (and your friends)!

#### Airboat Gun Mode

Sometimes, explosions are not enough. In that case, you can fire an Airboat Gun.  
It is highly effective to combine helicopters!

#### Combine Ball Mode

Tired of charging AR2 Alt Fire to shoot combine balls? This fire mode will cover you.  
With this, you can fire a very fast combine ball without any limitation.

#### Grenade Mode

Do you love spamming grenades? This will do the job for you much faster!
